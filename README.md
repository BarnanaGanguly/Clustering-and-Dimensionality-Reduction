# Clustering-and-Dimensionality-Reduction

In this repository, we delve into the `wine.csv` dataset, which details 11 chemical properties from 6,500 bottles of Vinho Verde wines from northern Portugal. Alongside the chemical insights, each wine is classified as red or white and rated on a quality scale of 1-10 by certified experts.

Our goal is to utilize dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and tSNE, coupled with clustering algorithms, to uncover patterns within these wines. Specifically, we aim to determine if unsupervised learning can discern between wine types and differentiate wines based on their quality scores. Explore our visual plots and summaries to understand the richness of our findings.
